Welcome to BSDanywhere 4.6 - OpenBSD at your fingertips!

You may now log in using either 'live' or 'root' as a user name. Both
accounts have no default password set. If you'd like to set one, use the
'passwd' program after you logged on. For 'live', a graphical environment
will be launched. You may use the 'sudo' command for priviliged commands.
