# Fishtails

This project is based off of the now defunct
[BSDAnywhere](http://bsdanywhere.org/) project, which at one time created
OpenBSD-based Live CDs.

The goal of Fishtails is not to create "just any live image" but rather to
create an OpenBSD-based incognito system modeled after
[Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) which itself is based on Debian.
